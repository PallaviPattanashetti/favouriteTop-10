                    <p class="card-text-">English literature is one of the richest traditions in the world, reflecting
                        the changes in human thought, emotion, and society over time. Beginning with the spirit of the
                        Renaissance, writers celebrated human life, knowledge, and imagination, moving away from purely
                        religious themes to explore love, ambition, and nature. As time passed, literature became more
                        reflective, expressing faith, inner conflict, and the search for truth, especially during times
                        of political and social change. With the rise of reason and scientific thinking, writers began
                        to focus on human behavior, moral values, and social manners, giving importance to clarity,
                        balance, and logic in their works. Later, literature turned toward emotion and imagination,
                        highlighting the beauty of nature, personal freedom, and deep human feelings. The growth of the
                        novel brought stories of real people, their struggles, and their moral choices. Gradually,
                        writers began to examine social injustice, poverty, and class differences, making literature a
                        mirror of life. Each period built on the last, showing how language and ideas evolved with
                        society. From poetry and drama to novels and essays, English literature grew into a powerful
                        form of art that teaches, inspires, and connects generations. It remains important today because
                        it helps us understand human nature, history, and the endless power of words.
