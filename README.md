Your website looks really great and I really like the styling of your Navbars. I did find a few issues that needs to be fixed. 

issues: back to top button isn't working in Lucas's Melodies Page as well as Pallavi's Metaphors (fixed)

Responsiveness isn't working as intended. Change col-md to col-lg will fix the issue for all pages. Also, please add a space between your two cards once the responsiveness stacks one on top of the other. You guys can add margin or padding to give it space!
