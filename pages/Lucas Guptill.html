        <h3>1. Deftones</h3>
        <p>
          Deftones have always been masters of contrast — balancing beauty and aggression in ways no other band can. 
          Their sound can shift from crushing heaviness to floating, ethereal calm in a single breath. 
          Albums like <em>White Pony</em> and <em>Koi No Yokan</em> changed the landscape of heavy music forever, proving it can be 
          emotional, cinematic, and deeply human. Every song feels like an atmosphere — something you don't just hear but feel. 
          They've taught me that music doesn't have to fit into one sound; it can exist between chaos and serenity and still be art.

        <h3>2. Poppy</h3>
        <p>
          Poppy represents creativity without limits. Her music is unpredictable — a bold mix of pop, metal, and industrial chaos. 
          She embodies reinvention, showing that art can evolve with no rules. Her transformation from an internet oddity to a 
          powerful artist with albums like <em>I Disagree</em> and <em>Zig</em> has been inspiring. 
          What makes Poppy special is her willingness to destroy expectations and rebuild herself, showing that expression can be 
          both violent and beautiful. She reminds me that self-expression should never be contained.

        <h3>3. Destroy Boys</h3>
        <p>
          Destroy Boys bring back everything that makes punk real — emotion, rebellion, and honesty. 
          Their songs are raw and messy in the best way, full of energy that makes you want to shout along. 
          Their lyrics reflect what it feels like to grow up lost, angry, and passionate about finding who you are. 
          There's no filter or perfection here — just emotion laid bare. 
          They remind me that music doesn't have to be polished to be powerful; sometimes it's the imperfections that hit the hardest.

        <h3>4. Daft Punk</h3>
        <p>
          Daft Punk reshaped electronic music forever. They combined funk, disco, and house into something both nostalgic and futuristic. 
          Their attention to rhythm and atmosphere creates music that feels alive — every beat tells a story. 
          From <em>Homework</em> to <em>Random Access Memories</em>, they captured emotion through machines, showing that technology can be soulful. 
          Their legacy lives in every artist inspired by their innovation and mystery. 
          They've taught me that art doesn't have to show its face to be human — it just has to connect.

        <h3>5. Mitski</h3>
        <p>
          Mitski's music feels like poetry set to sound. Her lyrics explore loneliness, identity, and vulnerability in a way that feels personal and universal. 
          Every song carries emotional weight, balancing beauty and melancholy with incredible honesty. 
          Her albums like <em>Be the Cowboy</em> and <em>Laurel Hell</em> are emotional journeys through heartbreak, self-doubt, and the search for meaning. 
          Mitski reminds me that strength can exist in softness, and that music can express feelings words alone never could.

        <h3>6. Radiohead</h3>
        <p>
          Radiohead redefine what it means to be a band. Their music refuses to stay in one place — evolving from alt-rock to electronic experimentation and beyond. 
          Albums like <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em> challenged how people listen to music, blending emotion with complexity. 
          Their sound captures anxiety, beauty, and reflection all at once. 
          They've shown me that art doesn't need to be understood — it just needs to make you feel something real.

        <h3>7. Arctic Monkeys</h3>
        <p>
          Arctic Monkeys have a sound that evolves with their listeners. 
          From their raw early albums to the cinematic atmosphere of <em>Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino</em>, 
          they've mastered the art of reinvention. 
          Alex Turner's lyrics are sharp and reflective, capturing emotion with a cool, almost poetic detachment. 
          Their music has grown alongside me, feeling like a reflection of change, maturity, and the complexity of identity.

        <h3>8. My Chemical Romance</h3>
        <p>
          My Chemical Romance turned pain into art. 
          Their music combines theater, emotion, and rebellion — reminding listeners that it's okay to feel deeply. 
          Albums like <em>The Black Parade</em> and <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em> blend punk, rock, and storytelling in a way that changed alternative music forever. 
          They gave a voice to the misunderstood and made emotion something to celebrate. 
          Their music helped me understand that being expressive and dramatic doesn't mean weakness — it means authenticity.

        <p>
          Basement's music feels like nostalgia bottled up in sound. 
          Their mix of alternative rock and emotional storytelling captures everything I love about raw, heartfelt music. 
          Their songs have this quiet intensity — heavy yet full of warmth. 
          Every lyric feels genuine, reflecting longing, youth, and memory. 
          They remind me that sometimes simplicity hits harder than complexity, and that emotion can be found in every note.

        <h3>10. Death Grips</h3>
        <p>
          Death Grips are chaos turned into art. 
          Their sound is aggressive, experimental, and completely unpredictable — a blend of hip-hop, noise, and raw emotion. 
          Listening to them feels like being dropped into another world where energy and intensity rule everything. 
          They've challenged how I think about music and creativity, showing that art doesn't always have to be comfortable. 
          Sometimes, the most powerful art is the one that makes you uncomfortable — because it forces you to feel.
