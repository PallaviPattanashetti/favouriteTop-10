                            Music has always been one of the biggest influences in my life. It's something that pushes
                            me forward,
                            fuels my creativity, and helps me make sense of emotions that words alone can't describe.
                            From the heavy,
                            textured sounds of alternative rock and shoegaze to the raw emotion of punk and the
                            electronic depth of
                            experimental music, each genre speaks to a different part of who I am. Every song has the
                            power to set a mood,
                            change a day, or open up a new perspective. I'm drawn to artists who take risks and create
                            something that feels alive—those who aren't afraid to be
                            unconventional, emotional, or loud. These ten artists have shaped the way I think about
                            music and creativity.
                            They've inspired me to look deeper into sound itself, to appreciate how rhythm and emotion
                            can blend into
                            something truly so unforgettable, so i decided to theme my top 10 list around some of my
                            favorite artists. Im looking to pursue a college education
                            in music for a long while to get a stable grasp on music theory and to play at a level above
                            my own. I love music more than anything and im constantly
                            going to see shows with friends and party hard, ive been to about 4 different shows this
                            year from my chemical romance to Narrow Head.
                            Theres really nothing better than going out to experience my favorite artists especially
                            with friends, when it comes to every show
                            ive seen its always been amazing.

                            English literature is one of the richest traditions in the world, reflecting
                            the changes in human thought, emotion, and society over time. Beginning with the spirit of
                            the
                            Renaissance, writers celebrated human life, knowledge, and imagination, moving away from
                            purely
                            religious themes to explore love, ambition, and nature. As time passed, literature became
                            more
                            reflective, expressing faith, inner conflict, and the search for truth, especially during
                            times
                            of political and social change. With the rise of reason and scientific thinking, writers
                            began
                            to focus on human behavior, moral values, and social mannerisms, giving significant
                            importance to clarity,
                            balance, and logic in their works. Later, literature turned toward emotion and imagination,
                            highlighting the beauty of nature, personal freedom, and deep human feelings. The growth of
                            the
                            novel brought stories of real people, their struggles, and their moral choices. Gradually,
                            writers began to examine social injustice everywhere, poverty, and class differences, making
                            literature
                            a
                            mirror of life. Each period built on the last, showing how language and ideas evolved with
                            society. From poetry and drama to novels and essays, English literature grew into a powerful
                            form of art that teaches, inspires, and connects generations. It remains important today
                            because
                            it helps us understand our human nature, history, and the endless power of our own words.
